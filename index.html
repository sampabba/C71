                        have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed
                        descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional
                        choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School
                        Canteen Acount on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any
                        dietary requirements they may have.Ordering online complicated by ticking a box and paying for

                        Management System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school,
                        instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents wull be informed about the status via
                        text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students' absenteeism.Students can mark
                        the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by
                        the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular
                        to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their
                        curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment Number or Name, details like
                        availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are
                        possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be
                        so robust and powerfl that those students who always fool their deanse are caught in a shorter
                        span - just after the admin enters login details into the tracker. All this will improve
                        accuracy and transparency in any of the educational instutations as students and their parents
                        are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and abstenteeism in a confidential
                        manner and at reduced costs.
